# Trainer Sheet (Pokémon-inspired) — Local-First Character Sheet UI

A **local-first**, player-facing **reference UI** for a Pokémon-inspired tabletop RPG character sheet.  
This is **not** a game engine and does not run battles, rolls, or automation logic.

## What it does
- Trainer info
- 4 Pokémon slots
- Active Pokémon preview panel
- Roles + role progression tracking
- Nest / Great / Signature moves + preview
- Abilities
- Trainer Actions + usage counters
- Local save/restore via `localStorage`
- Export/Import a single JSON file (portable save)

## Local-first by design
All edits are stored in your browser (`localStorage`) on your device.  
Export/Import lets you move your sheet between devices or share a save file.

## Quick start (local)
### Option A: VSCode Live Server (recommended)
1. Open the folder in VSCode
2. Install **Live Server**
3. Right-click `CharacterSheet.html` → **Open with Live Server**

### Option B: Any static server
Serve this folder with a simple static server of your choice.

> Avoid opening the HTML via `file://` directly; some browsers restrict JSON loading/fetching.

---

## GitHub Pages deployment (optional)
This project is static and can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Recommended:
- Rename `CharacterSheet.html` → `index.html` so Pages loads automatically at the site root.

2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
4. Branch: `main` (or `master`), folder: `/root`

## Data & IP / Takedown Risk Notes (PLEASE READ)
This project is intended as a **fan-made tabletop character sheet UI**. To reduce takedown risk:

### Non-affiliation
This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Nintendo, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, or any related entities.

### Trademarks
“Pokémon” and related marks are trademarks of their respective owners.  
Use of the term “Pokémon” here is **referential only**.

### Content policy (recommended)
To minimize risk, this repo should **avoid including copyrighted text** or proprietary game content (e.g., full move descriptions, ability descriptions, Pokédex entries, official art, logos, sprites, or scans).

**Best practice:** ship one of these options:
- **Option 1 (lowest risk):** empty JSON templates + user fills their own data
- **Option 2:** a small, original “demo dataset” with **original names/descriptions** (no official text)
- **Option 3 (higher risk):** only names/IDs with no official descriptions/art, and require users to add any descriptive text themselves

If you keep official names in datasets, that is generally lower risk than distributing full official text/art, but it can still draw attention depending on scope and usage.

### No official assets
Do **not** include:
- official artwork, sprites, logos
- official move/ability descriptions
- official Pokédex text
- copyrighted rulebook text

### No commercial intent
This project is intended for **personal tabletop use**. Do not sell it, bundle it with paid content, or gate features behind payment.

## Export / Import
- **Export:** downloads a single JSON file containing your current sheet state.
- **Import:** loads that file back into the sheet.

Tip: exports can be shared between devices, but they may contain personal notes.

---

## Security / Privacy
- Data is stored locally in your browser.
- Nothing is sent to a server (unless you host it yourself somewhere and modify it).
- Treat exported JSON like a save file—don’t share it if it contains private notes.

---

## License
**Code:** choose a permissive license (MIT recommended).  
**Data:** ensure any included dataset is original or licensed for redistribution.

> If you intend to distribute large datasets that mirror official content, consider removing them from the repo and providing templates instead.
